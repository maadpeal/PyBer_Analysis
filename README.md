# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
    - It is required to explore the large amount of data and display the information graphically 
    in order to improve its understanding and this will help us to recognize how to improve the 
    shared ride service and know the affordability for neglected neighborhoods.

## Results
    - As can be seen in the image, rural-type cities have the worst performance in rates, being 
    above suburban, and then, finally, those that have the best performance in rates are those 
    that are urban (image A-1).

#### Total Rides
    - The total number of rural trips are 125 (image B-1)
    - The total number of suburban trips are 625 (image B-1)
    - The total number of urban trips is 1625 (image B-1)

#### Total Drivers
    - There are 78 drivers in rural-type cities (image B-1)
    - There are 625 drivers in suburban-type cities (image B-1)
    - There are 1625 drivers in urban-type cities (image B-1)

#### Total Fares
    - The sum of all the rates of the cities of the rural type is $4,327.93 (image B-1)
    - The sum of all the rates of the cities of the suburban type is $19,356.33 (image B-1)
    - The sum of all the rates of the cities of the urban type is $39,854.38 (image B-1)

#### Average by city type
    - The Average Fare per Ride for rural cities is $34.62 (image B-1)
    - The Average Fare per Ride for suburban cities is $30.97 (image B-1)
    - The Average Fare per Ride for urban cities is $24.53 (image B-1)

#### Average by Drivers
    - The Average Fare per Driver for rural cities is $55.49 (image B-1)
    - The Average Fare per Driver for suburban cities is $39.50 (image B-1)
    - The Average Fare per Driver for urban cities is $16.57 (image B-1)

## Summary
    - If we are guided solely by what the data indicates, we should recommend to the CEO that he find a way 
    to reduce rates in suburban and rural areas in order to increase profits in these two types of cities.
    - The problem with the above is that probably in rural and suburban areas the distance traveled is much 
    longer than in urban areas, which is an important point to consider.
    - Another factor may be that costs are higher in these areas because drivers do not want to go to those 
    areas. If that is the case, drivers could be incentivized with rewards for attending those areas that are 
    difficult to access. This would allow us to give customers the security that they can count on the service in those areas.
    - Another measure that could be implemented is to create recommendation programs among 
    users with free trips to those who share it with their contacts, this would increase the demand for the service 
    in these areas of difficult access.
    - But to truly determine what type of strategy can best be adjusted to this case, it is necessary to look 
    for more data that can validate or refute the hypotheses that we are proposing.
